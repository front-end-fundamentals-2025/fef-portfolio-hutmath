        <h2>Life of Mathilda</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in a family of 6, my parents and two brothers and a sister.
            I've lived most of my life in Sweden in the city of Uppsala, but for 8 months my parents voluntered in Thailand,<br />
            we lived there for 8 months. <br />
            For most of my childhood and early adult years, our family had two dogs,
            so I consider them a part of the family as well. <br />
